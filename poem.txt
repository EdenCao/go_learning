Poetry has a long history,
dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa,
and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile,
Niger and Volta river valleys [4].
Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE,
while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry.
The earliest Western Asian epic poetry,
the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.
Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing,
or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas,
Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics,
focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy.
Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme,
and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative,
prosaic forms of writing.
